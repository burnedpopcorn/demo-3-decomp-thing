GameMaker Version used: 2022.0.1.31 (2022 LTS)

Current Issues:

- conveyor belts are buggy

Changes made by burnedpopcorn

- added asset order note, just in case
- Changed ALL Sounds to "Compressed - Not Streamed", since that's how the original game did it
- Updated Main, Windows, and GX.GAMES Game Options to be completely the same as the original executable
(as in Display Name, Version #, Company, Product, Copyright, Description, and Project and EXE Image have been changed to be the same)

Fixes
- Fixed scr_roomnames to apply Room Messages to the Correct Rooms
- Fixed obj_eventtrigger Creation Code
- Fixed mr car instantly disappearing when killed
- Removed any "gml_Script_" parts, since in comments they're useless, and in code fucks up everything

NOTES
scr_playerstep() is the main thing for Player States
